# QMetaObject crate for Rust

[![Appveyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8l5te3wlj2ie4njc/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ogoffart/qmetaobject-rs/branch/master)

[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/qmetaobject/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/qmetaobject/)

A framework empowering everyone to create Qt/QML applications with Rust.
It does so by building `QMetaObject`s at compile time, registering QML types (optionally via exposing `QQmlExtensionPlugin`s) and providing native wrappers.

## Objectives

 - Rust procedural macro (custom derive) to generate a `QMetaObject` at compile time.
 - Bindings for the main Qt types using the `cpp!` macro from the [`cpp`](https://crates.io/crates/cpp) crate.
 - Users of this crate should not require to type any line of C++ or use another build system beyond cargo.
 - Performance: Avoid any unnecessary conversion or heap allocation.

## Overview

```rust
use cstr::cstr;
use qmetaobject::prelude::*;

// The `QObject` custom derive macro allows to expose a class to Qt and QML
#[derive(QObject, Default)]
struct Greeter {
    // Specify the base class with the qt_base_class macro
    base: qt_base_class!(trait QObject),
    // Declare `name` as a property usable from Qt
    name: qt_property!(QString; NOTIFY name_changed),
    // Declare a signal
    name_changed: qt_signal!(),
    // And even a slot
    compute_greetings: qt_method!(fn compute_greetings(&self, verb: String) -> QString {
        format!("{} {}", verb, self.name.to_string()).into()
    })
}

fn main() {
    // Register the `Greeter` struct to QML
    qml_register_type::<Greeter>(cstr!("Greeter"), 1, 0, cstr!("Greeter"));
    // Create a QML engine from rust
    let mut engine = QmlEngine::new();
    // (Here the QML code is inline, but one can also load from a file)
    engine.load_data(r#"
        import QtQuick 2.6
        import QtQuick.Window 2.0
        // Import our Rust classes
        import Greeter 1.0

        Window {
            visible: true
            // Instantiate the rust struct
            Greeter {
                id: greeter;
                // Set a property
                name: "World"
            }
            Text {
                anchors.centerIn: parent
                // Call a method
                text: greeter.compute_greetings("hello")
            }
        }
    "#.into());
    engine.exec();
}
```

## Features

 - Create object inheriting from QObject, QQuickItem, QAbstractListModel, QQmlExtensionPlugin, ...
 - Export Qt properties, signals, methods, ...
 - Also support `#[derive(QGadget)]` (same as Q_GADGET)
 - Create Qt plugin (see examples/qmlextensionplugins)
 - Partial scene graph support

Requires Qt >= 5.8

## Cargo features

Cargo provides a way to enable (or disable default) optional [features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html).

### `log`

By default, Qt's logging system is not initialized, and messages from e.g. QML's `console.log` don't go anywhere.
The "log" feature enables integration with [`log`](https://crates.io/crates/log) crate, the Rust logging facade.

The feature is enabled by default. To activate it, execute the following code as early as possible in `main()`:

```rust
fn main() {
    qmetaobject::log::init_qt_to_rust();
    // don't forget to set up env_logger or any other logging backend.
}
```

### `chrono_qdatetime`

Enables interoperability of `QDate` and `QTime` with Rust [`chrono`](https://crates.io/crates/chrono) package.

This feature is disabled by default.

### `webengine`

Enables `QtWebEngine` functionality. For more details see the [example](./examples/webengine).

This feature is disabled by default.

## What if a binding for the Qt C++ API you want to use is missing?

It is quite likely that you would like to call a particular Qt function which is not wrapped by
this crate.

In this case, it is always possible to access C++ directly from your rust code using the `cpp!` macro.

Example: from [`examples/graph/src/main.rs`](./examples/graph/src/main.rs#L37), the struct `Graph` is a `QObject` deriving from `QQuickItem`,
`QQuickItem::setFlag` is currently not exposed in the API but we wish to call it anyway.

```rust
impl Graph {
    fn appendSample(&mut self, value: f64) {
        // ...
        let obj = self.get_cpp_object();
        cpp!(unsafe [obj as "QQuickItem *"] { obj->setFlag(QQuickItem::ItemHasContents); });
        // ...
    }
}
```

But ideally, we should wrap as much as possible so this would not be needed. You can request API
as a github issue, or contribute via a pull request.
